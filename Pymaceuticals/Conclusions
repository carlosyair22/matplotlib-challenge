We evaluated the different drugs based on their results in changes in the tumor size and metastasis sites.
- Out of the 9 drugs tested, only two (Capomulin, Ramicane) had positive results in terms of reducing the tumor size after the treatment. The remaining 7, had no meaningful difference agains the Placebo
- These results where also consistent in the test of metastasis sites. Capomulin and Ramicane had the lower sites after 45 days of treatment. With a significant difference from the rest of the drugs
- The survival rate also showned a consistent result. 80%+ of the initital population treated with Capomulin and Ramicane survived after 45 days. In the rest of drugs the survival rate was below 50% in all cases.
- Finally, the results of the two drugs that passed the test were very close, which implies that additional tests would be required to determine which one is optimal for treatment
